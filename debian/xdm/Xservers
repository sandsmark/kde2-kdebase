# Xservers file, workstation prototype
#
# This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
# local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
# you can add entries to the list (one per line).  If you also
# have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
# you can add them here as well.  Each X terminal line should
# look like:
#	XTerminalName:0 foreign
#
# When adding X servers, please keep the following things in mind:
# - For each X server other than :0, the display number must be on the command
#   line.
# - This is the place to add the -bpp option to the command line.
# - It is wise to add the vtXX option to each local X server, since this is
#   the only sure way of knowing in advance which X server attaches to which
#   console.
# - See the Xserver(1) manpage for a description of X server options.
#
# Examples for multiple local X displays:
# :0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :0 vt9 -bpp 16
# :1 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X :1 vt10 -bpp 8
:0 local@tty1 /usr/X11R6/bin/X  -dpi 100 -nolisten tcp vt7
